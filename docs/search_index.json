And given a specific genre that we want to focus on, what are audiences common sentiment towards this type of anime, and what should we do to satisfy their need. As an Anime fan, if my friends want me to recommend an Anime, what should my recommendation be based on (genre, number of episodes, length, anime topic) so that my friends would find what they truly want and love. As time goes, how each genre of anime evolved (number of episodes, average length, and other characteristics), and how the taste of audience evolved. Would the most popular genre (evaluate by number of anime that are based on this genre) have the highest rating? 1.2 How do we solve these questions For the first question, we could group the dataset by genre and plot their info respectively. Given a specific genre, we could filter the dataset and apply sentiment analysis to the review data to see how users feel about this genre, we may further separate the review data by ratings to examine if there are differences between emotions of high rating reviews and low rating reviews. For the second question, we could cluster the anime and users after feature engineering to see if there are significant features that affect ones taste of anime. For the third question, we could extract features that could accurately measure popularity and quality from the dataset, and then plot the data in each time period to see how these features evolve as time goes. 1.3 Additional features Please consult the official guide to bookdown: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Description of dataset", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Description of dataset We will develop a web crawler to get data from MyAnimeList, a professional anime rating website in Europe and North America. According to Wikipedia, the site received 120 million visitors a month in 2015. The dataset will include several tables, the first one is the Anime table (anime ID, name, average rating, genre and synopsis), the second one is the watching status table (user_id, anime_id, watching_status, watched_episodes), the last one is the review table (user_id, anime_id, review_text, review_score) Anime "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Data import and basic examination 4.2 Deal with missing values in the profile dataset 4.3 Deal with missing values in the ratings dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values In this part, we deal with missing values from two datasets: Anime Rating and User Profile. Since the myAnimeList website maintains a well-structured database, most of its entries are complete, except for some unavoidable data entries. We will examine the two datasets and see if there are some patterns in it. 4.1 Data import and basic examination ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## user_id anime_id rating watching_status watched_episodes ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 67 9 1 1 ## 2 0 6702 7 1 4 ## 3 0 242 10 1 4 ## 4 0 4898 NA 1 1 ## 5 0 21 10 1 0 ## 6 0 24 9 1 5 ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## profile gender birthday favorites_anime num_favorite age ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 DesolatePsyche Male Oct 2, 1994 [&#39;33352&#39;, &#39;25013&#39;, &#39;5530&#39;, &#39;33674&#39;, &#39;1482~ 165 28 ## 2 baekbeans Female Nov 10, 2000 [&#39;11061&#39;, &#39;31964&#39;, &#39;853&#39;, &#39;20583&#39;, &#39;918&#39;,~ 83 22 ## 3 skrn &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; [&#39;918&#39;, &#39;2904&#39;, &#39;11741&#39;, &#39;17074&#39;, &#39;23273&#39;~ 74 NA ## 4 edgewalker00 Male Sep 5 [&#39;5680&#39;, &#39;849&#39;, &#39;2904&#39;, &#39;3588&#39;, &#39;37349&#39;] 40 NA ## 5 aManOfCulture99 Male Oct 30, 1999 [&#39;4181&#39;, &#39;7791&#39;, &#39;9617&#39;, &#39;5680&#39;, &#39;2167&#39;, ~ 80 23 ## 6 eneri &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; [&#39;5114&#39;, &#39;4898&#39;, &#39;2904&#39;, &#39;1575&#39;, &#39;1482&#39;] 40 NA 4.2 Deal with missing values in the profile dataset From the plot above, we could see that the largest proportion of rows are complete, but there are still a considerable amount of rows which have 1,2,3 missing values, and we will examine column distribution of missing values. ## col_na_profile ## age 42470 ## birthday 34920 ## gender 27871 ## profile 0 ## favorites_anime 0 ## num_favorite 0 From the table we could see that the age, birthday, and gender columns all have a lot of missing values, while the profile, favorite_anime and num_favorite columns are all filled with informative values. Next, we examine the missing value distribution in a more broad perspective, as the dataset is too large and not feasible for this plot, we sampled only 200 rows randomly, which qualifies to display the general trend of the data. From the plot we could see that the three columns have large ratio of missing values, this makes sense since these three rows are all sensitive information of the users and some of them may not be willing to share this information, and all anime-related columns are filled completely, which meets our expectation. With the plot_missing function, we could see five different missing patterns (if any column is missing). The largest portion of data is complete, and the most common missing pattern is that all three columns that involve sensitive information (age, birthday and gender) are missing, then is age and birthday, other missing patterns are relatively uncommon. 4.3 Deal with missing values in the ratings dataset Next, we examine the missing values in the rating dataset. From the table below, we could see that slightly more than half of the dataset is complete, but there are still considerable amount of rows that have at least one missing value. This makes sense in the website description, since some of the users may mark the watching status of a certain anime, but they may not rate it right away, which leads to a large portion of unrated anime in the rating database. ## row_na_rating Freq ## 1 0 12506062 ## 2 1 9340576 ## 3 2 94 Next, we examine the missing pattern among columns. We could see that most of the missing values lie in the rating column, and very few lie in the watching_status column. The first point has been addressed in the previous paragraph, and the second point makes sense because users may very rarely mark the watching status as an invalid value that cannot be correctly encoded by the system, which leads to the 165 missing values in this column. ## col_na_rating ## rating 9340599 ## watching_status 165 ## user_id 0 ## anime_id 0 ## watched_episodes 0 Similar to the last part, we have to sample the dataset to make the plot, and we could see that almost all missing values lie in the rating column. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Sentiment Analysis", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Sentiment Analysis 5.1.1 Heatmap During the data processing part, we apply sentiment analysis using NRC Sentiment lexion. The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a list of English words and their associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive). The annotations were manually done by crowdsourcing. We then plot the average sentiment values with respect to different genres of anime to see any patterns of reviews. We can see some of the interesting patterns: From the Sentiment heatmap of animes by genres, we found that most of the animes have the sentiment with trust and joy. Which, are two of the most positive emotions. For anime in Advantures, there are more joy and trust than other genres, and less anger, disgust and sadness. These make sense since most of the animes belong to this genre tend to give audiences a feeling of excitement and happiness. For anime in Yaoi, there are more surprise than other genres. This also make sense since many of these animes are made by anime lovers instead of original authors. Audiences may feel surprised seeing different stories compared to the orignial ones. For anime in Shoujo Ai, there are less trust and more fear than other genres. This might because many of the audiences are children or adolescents. This type of genre, however, may not be appropriate for those audiences. Reviewers may express their concerns towards these genre. 5.1.2 Cluster Plot We plot the sentiment cluster plot to see any patterns or cluster among these anime genres. The cluster plot gives us the cluster of emotions of reviewers. As we can see from the heatmap, Yaoi and Yuri has the most change in surprise and trust. Therefore they are in the same cluster. For some genres like Vampire, Demons, Super Power, Magic and Psychological, they are in the same cluster. Which make sense. Cars and Thriller change mostly in some sentiment from the heatmap, so they are in the same cluster. For some genres like Shoujo, Shounen Ai, Harem and Hentai, they are in the same cluster. These are all some types of animes with small group of audiences. 5.1.3 PCA Finally we plot the PCA plot. From the plot, Yuri, Yaoi, Shounen Ai and Cars are most likely outliers to our dataset. The surprise indicator is most positively correlated with trust The anger indicator is most uncorrelated with trust The fear indicator is most negatively correlated with trust "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Overview 6.2 Introduction 6.3 Anime by Genre 6.4 Recommendation 6.5 Potential Problems", " Chapter 6 Interactive component The following is the interactive app website with our final project. 6.1 Overview By developing this Shiny app, we aim to provide a smooth experience for beginners to find their favorite animes, and some exploraion choices for anime experts to find more interesting animes. We decide to implemented three functions: Anime trending and search, random anime recommendation, as well as a tuned recommendation system that looks for anime that people with similar interests like. 6.2 Introduction Anime Trending: In this section, the customer could navigate through the anime database that are sorted by score, popularity, favorites and watching status, and get to see what anime fans are interested in! Follow the pace of other anime fans and find the most popular and highly rated anime! Anime Search: In this section, the customer could find a more tuned list by choosing some specific favorite type and genre, and see what are the top rated anime! 6.3 Anime by Genre This page is to give our customer a overview of the mean score of animes by genres and types. 6.4 Recommendation Our goal is to give our customer a recommendation list knowing one or two of the customers favorite animes. We use the language model to assign a probability to a piece of each animes name. In our daily life, language models are often used in typing software and web pages to predict the next word or paragraph of words. We select 4000 users favorite lists which contain anime lists sorted by time and popularity. We treat each anime name as a word and use Markov Assumption to infer the relationship between animes. We apply bigrams and trigrams models to give the customers a choice of writing down one or two anime they like. Our tab will return a list of anime ordered by probability and popularity. These are the animes users put in their favorite lists after the anime the customer typed in. 6.5 Potential Problems Our data set is realatively large, so it may take a long time for the website to show all of our results.
